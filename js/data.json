            "This fresh farmed Atlantic salmon fillet comes from Canada. Farmed salmon is a healthy and nutritious food. It is an oily fish particularly rich in omega 3, which is beneficial for cardiovascular health. It is also a good source of high-quality protein, vitamin D and calcium. Health Canada recommends eating at least two servings of oily fish per week as part of a balanced diet.",
